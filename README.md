üîç Adey_FraudDetection
üìã Project Overview
Adey_FraudDetection is a project designed for building robust and accurate fraud detection models to identify fraudulent transactions in e-commerce and banking. Adey Innovations Inc., a fintech leader, aims to enhance transaction security and mitigate financial losses through machine learning models capable of real-time monitoring and fraud detection.

üíº Business Need
Fraud detection is crucial to securing online transactions. This project focuses on:

Enhanced Security: Using machine learning to detect fraudulent activity efficiently, thus reducing risks and boosting customer trust.
Real-time Detection and Monitoring: Implementing a model for continuous monitoring, intervention, and rapid reporting.
Geolocation and Pattern Recognition: Analyzing transaction location and user behavior to improve accuracy.
üéØ Project Goals
Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing transaction data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features to identify fraud patterns.
Model Building and Training: Training models on e-commerce and bank credit data.
Model Explainability: Using SHAP and LIME for interpretability.
Model Deployment: Deploying models for real-time fraud detection with Flask and Docker.
Dashboard Development: Building a dashboard with Flask and Dash for data visualization.
üìÇ Data Sources
Fraud_Data.csv - E-commerce transactions, with details such as user demographics, IP address, and transaction value.
IpAddress_to_Country.csv - IP-to-country mappings for geographical analysis.
creditcard.csv - Bank transaction data, with anonymized features and timestamps.
