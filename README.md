# Adey_FraudDetection
Task 1 - Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Overview
This task focuses on the essential steps of data analysis and preprocessing in preparation for building machine learning models for fraud detection. The primary objective is to clean and prepare the datasets, ensuring that they are suitable for further analysis and model training.

Objectives
The key objectives of this task are as follows:

Handle Missing Values: Address any missing values in the dataset through imputation or removal.
Data Cleaning:
Remove any duplicate entries from the datasets.
Correct data types to ensure proper analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.
Merge Datasets for Geolocation Analysis:
Convert IP addresses into integer format for better handling.
Merge Fraud_Data.csv with IpAddress_to_Country.csv to associate transactions with geographic information.
Feature Engineering:
Calculate transaction frequency and velocity for the Fraud_Data.csv.
Extract time-based features such as:
hour_of_day
day_of_week
Normalization and Scaling: Apply normalization and scaling techniques to ensure that numerical features are on a similar scale.
Encode Categorical Features: Convert categorical features into numerical format for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
Methodology
Handling Missing Values:

Identify missing values using .isnull() and decide to either impute or drop them based on their significance.
Data Cleaning:

Use .drop_duplicates() to remove any duplicate entries.
Utilize pd.astype() to correct data types where necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Implement visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) to analyze the distribution of individual features.
Use scatter plots or correlation matrices to explore relationships between features.
Merge Datasets:

Convert IP addresses to integers using the appropriate conversion methods.
Perform a merge operation using pd.merge() to combine the fraud data with the geolocation data.
Feature Engineering:

Calculate transaction frequency and velocity through aggregation functions.
Use pd.to_datetime() to extract hour and day features from timestamp data.
Normalization and Scaling:

Implement normalization (e.g., Min-Max scaling) using sklearn.preprocessing.
Encode Categorical Features:

Apply techniques like One-Hot Encoding using pd.get_dummies() to convert categorical variables.
